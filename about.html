        <h2>About Na Laochra Aeracha</h2>
        <p><strong>Na Laochra Aeracha</strong> is Cork’s first LGBTQ+ inclusive GAA club, founded in 2023 to create a safe and welcoming space for people of all identities to engage in Gaelic football. Our name, meaning "gay warriors/heroes," represents our pride and sense of community.</p>
        <p>Training takes place every Wednesday at the Glen Resource Centre, with Aaron Kelly as our lead coach and chairperson. Our goal is not only to build Gaelic football skills but also to create a tight-knit community where everyone, regardless of fitness level or experience, is welcomed.</p>
        <h2>Inclusivity & Fun</h2>
        <p>Na Laochra Aeracha offers a safe space for everyone to enjoy GAA, whether you're a beginner or experienced player. With no judgment and a lot of laughter, our club is open to everyone, including LGBTQ+ allies. Some members even show up in full drag—reflecting the joyful, inclusive environment we've built!</p>
        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>Our sessions are fun and challenging for all levels, and we're always looking for new members—especially women and non-binary players. Whether you're looking to learn a new skill, make friends, or just have fun, Na Laochra Aeracha welcomes you to be part of our growing community!</p>
